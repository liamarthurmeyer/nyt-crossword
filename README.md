# NYT Mini Archive

[nytminiarchive.com](https://www.nytminiarchive.com/) is a web app that allows users to navigate to past NYT mini crosswords without a subscription. I built this for myself in order to access old minis easier and track my progress. 

## Setup

To run this code on your machine, navigate to the relevant directory and run `npm run start` then `npm run dev`.
